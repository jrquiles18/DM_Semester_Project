Project:  Tommy John Injury Prediction in Major League Baseball Pitchers (MLB)

Environment:  Jupyter notebook and python's sklearn libraries

The codes are organized by classification models used to predict MLB pitcher Tommy John injury:

1.  KNN
2.  Logistic Regression
3.  Naive Bayes
4.  SVM
5.  Neural Network
6.  Deep Learning

Create data set:
  Features(Pitch Percentages):
            1.  Fastball
            2.  Slider
            3.  Curveball
            4.  Changeup/Splitter
            5.  Sinker
            6.  Cutter
  
  Target: 
      No Tommny John Surgery = 0
      Tommy John Surgery = 1
          
Enter data into each of the above mentioned classification models for injury prediction
